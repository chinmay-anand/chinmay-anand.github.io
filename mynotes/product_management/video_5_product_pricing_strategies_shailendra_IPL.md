    * For SaaS we can use Fremium or Pay per use
    * First unlimited features for limited time and then Limited feature for unlimited time.
    * If customer does nto have much time to try out then we can start with Limited Features for a longer time to try so that conversion is easier.
    * Startup pricing of a B2B product during first launch --Value is based on assumptions. Put dewn the following:
      * 1. What is the value delivered to customer? For new B2B products use customer as cocreation partner (e.g. for SAP), so that it handles customer's critical business functionality. Initially the value add will be less but as we talk to more and more customers we will find the value add.
      * 2. Justify ROI is very imp in B2B. Customer will ask.
      * 3. What is the timing of the cashflows?
    * When to start high and go down and when to start low and go up? (Refer Appsmore)
*Initially partner with few **application marketplace**s like Appsmore or Appdirect etc, Customer visit there and will use your app for nomincal price (that you made agreement with that market place). Once tested and matured you can start charging more independently.
