  * Product sense is critical and other necessary things are agility, customer focussed, day to day activity etc.
  * "Many times plans are useless but planning is indispensable" - plans will be done, they will change due to changes in business plan and business priority (due to social and political landscape change), that is life of PdM.
  * The roadmap of a product manager should be able to respond to those changes, adapt and reflect those chagnes in the planning. Plans will change, resources will change, technology will change.

* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dRNzx8Pe54&t=17m35s) --> What is the role of customers and data
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dRNzx8Pe54&t=17m50s) --> What does customer really need (versus what he wants?) - answer lies in data. Need to be addressed. (If you ask customer will say what they want, but we need to relize what they really need.)
  * Our business is a customer-centric system (solar system is a helio centric system where all planets revolve around sun). Similarly our business metric, operational efficiency, revenues all go around customer.
  * The data is like solar gravitational force that ties the business systems with customer.
  * Customer keeps sending data points in a number of ways: usage patterns, primary reports, way they use our product or way they hate our product, product reviews they give at playstore or other forums etc.
  * If we are not understandign the data then we are not moving anywhere. Data does not make sense if we are not metric driven.
  * To save glasses from being wet, someone desinged wiper for glasses and some other intelligent PM desinged contact lenses i.e. want vs need. This needs product innovation etc.

        * Are we trying to:
          * increase DAUs (daily active users)
          * increase MAUs (monthly active users)
          * retain the customers
          * monetize more customers
          * increase the number of subscription etc, what one or mroe are our goal(s)..
    * **U**sers
      * Who are our users? - Users and theire needs (next point) are the most important ones.
        * E.g. Facebook: - If the goals were "engaggement", "likes", "shares", "comments" and so on,
          * Who are the users - content "creators" / "engagors" / "viewers" for videos / "opinion givers"
            * personas can be created for these types or groups of people, we are creating the product for.
    * User **N**eeds
      * What are the problems or needs of our users?

        * E.g. NEtflix
    * **S**olutions
      * What are the possible solutions to above problems or needs?
        * The solution need not be sophisticated initially, but it should solve teh problem, adn later it can be enhanced. 
    * **P**rioritize
      * Which solutions to build first and try?
          * E.g. Yellopages transformed into JsutDial with a solution of a number dial (88888888) to get yello page information, After many years they came up with a website.
          * What soulution do ypu have and how you will prioritize, e.g solving for speed or for accuracy and so on.
