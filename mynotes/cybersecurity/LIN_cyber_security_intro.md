# Cybersecurity Foundations (LIN)

APT Malware (Electronic disruption and cripe due to internet):
* Command and Control
* Process Injection
* Cloaking
* Exfiltration
* Reignition

SP 800-37r2 Risk Management Framework
* Level one - organization
* Level two - Mission/Business process
* Level three - Information system

Requriement is communication across levels, Risk management across levels, with more detailed risk perspective at IT system level and Broad based risk perspective at organization level.

IoT Device Classifications
* Class 0 -- Minimal impact on an individual or organization.
* Class 1 -- Designed to resist attack on availablity.
* Class 2 -- Significant impact on individuals or an organization.
* Class 3 -- Designed to resist attacks and protect sensitive data. Significant impact on individuals or an organization.

Process for Management of Enterprise IT:
* Align, Plan, and Organize (APO01-APO13)
* Build, Aquire, and Implement (BAI01-BAI13)
* Deliver, Service, and Support (DSS01-DSS06)
* Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess (MEA01-MEA03) - This spans across all the previous 3 processes (APO-BAI-DSS).

APO **01 to 13** are Manage IT Managmeent Framework--Strategu--Enterprise Architecture--Innovation--Portfolio--Budget and Costs--Human Resources--Relationships--Service Agreements--Suppliers--Quality--Risk--Manage Security

BAI **01 to 10** are Manage Program and Projects--Requirement Definition--Solution Identification and Build--Availability and Capacity--Organizational Change Enablement--Changes--Change Acceptance and Transition--Knowledge--Asset--Manage Configuraiton

Basics of responding to Cyber Risks
* NIST SP 800-61 (1.Preparation, 3.Detection and Analysis, 4.Containment and Eradication, 5.Post-Incident Activity)
* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (1.Planning, 2.Communicate, 3.Analysis, 4.Mitigation, 5.Improvements)
* Crest UK (1.Prepare, 2,3,4.Respond, 5.Follow Up)

Multi-Tiered Control Strategy:
1. Deterent reduces Threats
2. Preventive reduces Vulnerabilities
3. Detective reduces Incidents
4. Corrective reduces Impacts

IT professional need to be aware of:
* Cybersecurity standards and frameworks
* Need to be familiar with technology risk and control

Frameworks
* Best practice model for IT processes is ISACA's Control Objectives for IT -- http://isaca.org/cobit/pages/default.aspx (Information System Audit and Control Association)
* NIST Cybersecurity Framework is https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework -- recognized appraoch to cybersecurity in internet enabled world.
