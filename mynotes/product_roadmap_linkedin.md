# Product Management: Building a Product Roadmap

### What is a product roadmap?
<details><summary>What is a product roadmap</summary>

  * A product roadmap is a long term development plan that gives product stakeholders the information they need to coordinate their planning.
  * Product roadmaps are extremely valuable even though not critical to success of business, even when we work in agile product development where short sprints are planned that too in a dynamic market environment.
  * The product roadmap gives predictability to the product development process, and everybody loves predictability.

</details>

<details><summary>How your product roadmap makes the <b>product stakeholders</b> more effective:</summary>
 
  * __Customers:__ The roadmap helps the large enterprise customers to make purchasing and inplementation decisions, especially when the industry is new and changing quickly.
  * __Customer-facing groups__ (sales/marketing/customer-support) - They use the product roadmap to develop their maretial like documentation and training and this work needs some lead time.
  * __Investors, board, sponsors:__ They need your product roadmap to estimate future revenues, and costs and decide what level of resources to allocate to your group including financial investments and hiring plans.
  * __Architects, engineers and designers:__ They can use the visibility provided by the road map to design higher-quality designs of the product.
    * Without the long-term plan the design will be in piecemeal and can create unforeseen problems. Also plans of other departments will fail without a longer term plan (product roadmap).
  * __Human resources:__ They may need to change their hiring plan.
  * __Legal:__ They may need to develop the contracts.

<details><summary>Organizational benefits of Product roadmap</summary>

  * Product roadmap forces the leadership team to clearly articulate its business goals and its strategy for achieving them.
  * Having a product roadmap helps ensure that your product development efforts are aligned as closely as possible with your strategy.
  * And having the key stakeholders aligned around that roadmap ensures that everyone works together effectively.

</details>

<details><summary>Product roadmap template</summary>

  * Roadmap for a small team with an early stage product can be a whiteboard photo of prioritized list of future initiatives.
  * Roadmap for a large organization with a mature product can be a long slide deck with a detailed product strategy and a feature breakdowns of each project.
  * Format of the roadmap is far less important than the support of key stakeholders and their alignment. Key to building stakeholder alignment is the roadmap creation process, not the final format not even the content of the roadmap.
  * A typical product roadmap is a graphical layout slide, which shows:
    * future time periods along the x-axis at the bottom.
      * -- this can be weeks, months, quarters or years depending on the product maturity and the development process) and
    * different products along the y-axis on the left
      * -- This can be product, or product categories, or customer segments, or strategic initiatives, or different platforms we support
    * And plot the milestone for each product across the grid.
      * Milestones can be put as text boxes positioned at the release date OR
      * They could be a horizontal bar ending on the release date. This is the time period when dev team will be working on them.
      * -- Each milestone should be a meaningful bundle of new functionality that will have significant impact on our business.
  * Product roadmap is not a complete document and instead it must be simple and easy to understand by all stakeholders (including key customers) to coordinate their planning around the product development plan.
  * Creating a roadmap with right release dates in a way that implements your product strategy and has all stakeholders aligned, is a daunting task.

### Roadmaps in agile organization
<details><summary>Roadmaps in agile organizations</summary>

  * Backlog is a prioritized queue of the next most important product development tasks. It is not at all same as roadmap. It is directed by roadmap.
  * Each milestone of the product roadmap eventually need to be turned into a large number of backlog tasks.
  * The stakeholders, i.e. customers, marketing group, finance groups are typically interested in milestones (of product roadmap) that will bring new customers, new marketing efforts, new revenue.
  * To complete a milestone, our team need to complete large number of tasks (user stories or bugs) form the product backlog.
  * Product roadmap gives milestones, the backlogs does not give any release date.
  * IMP: We need to put dates on product milestones even before the constituent backlog tasks don't have yet any date.
    * We need to estimate the dates for product milestones on the roadmap using a completely independent set of top-down estimates from your product development leader.
    * As long as they are close (even though inaccurate) , they will serve the purpose of allowing coordination among the different product stakeholders.
  * As the backlog is directed by product roadmap, it is crucial to ensure the activities of product development team are aligned to the needs and goals of the whole organization.
  
</details>

<details><summary>Roadmaps for early-stage products</summary>

   * We can start building a product roadmap if the product is mature enough, it has achieved a product market fit  and we are able to articulate a produc strategy that is based on solid market and customer knowledge.
   * Our product is said to have a product market fit, if we have a set of active, engaged customers who would be very disappointed if they did not have access to our product.
   * In early stages of product,
     * until you get to product market fit, you should have a set of hypotheses that you're validating at every given moment.
     * And instead of a roadmap, you should have a list of development projects that will allow you to validate these hypotheses as efficiently as possible.
     * Our purpose of product development should be to learn about the market and the customers and validate the hypotheses that will later form the basis of the product strategy.
   * In very early stages of a product
     * we donot know enough about the market, customer, and product to form a coherent well-founded strategy, and we are still exploring them
     * we have probably ideas about some unmet custoemr needs and a possible way to meet those needs to create business balue.
     * it will be foolish to plan to decid what we will develop far into the future, even if your business head asks for a roadmap. Explain them the hypotheses that you are validating, and promise them to build a roadmap after you have got to product market fit.

* #### Laying the Groundwork for Product Roadmap

<details><summary>Importance of Product roadmap process</summary>

  * An Example when a brilliant roadmap failed:
    * Say CEO and product leader has prepared an excellent product roadmap prepaed and presented at company board meeting.
    * But weeks into the execution the things started falling apart. Development is getting delayed (when asked now VP Engg says the timeline was not realistic but he was not asked to give feedback initially)
    * Later when a version is released with strategic features sales did not meed expectation. VP Sales told that the product features does not match with what customers were waiting for, but he was not asked for feedback initially even when he waS already aware of the fact, so the sales numbers can not be met.
    * The problem with this roadmap was that CEO and the product leader did not take time to get the team aligned around the roadmap in advance. The roadmap was excellent along with a brilliant strategy, but it failed due to misalignment.
  * The purpose of product development is to serve the business, to support the company's overall strategy, usually by winning customer adoption, loyalty, and ultimately, revenue.
  * And that almost always requires that all of the different functional groups in your company work together, including sales, marketing, customer support and so on.
  * Alignment is easier to achieve when you include your stakeholders early in the process, when you take the time to ask for their feedback and address it, and when you keep all of your stakeholders updated as the plan takes shape and evolves into its final form.
  * When people are involved in making something, they feel ownership, and they'll promote and defend it.
  * Even though the meeting required for building alignment seem redundant and laborious they are necessary.
  
  * ###### IMP: Alternate wat of thinking
    * Assume: The stakeholder alignment itself is actually the goal, and the resulting product roadmap document is only there as a reminder of what you are aligned around.

<details><summary><b>Why Roadmaps Fail</b></summary>

* Things needed for success of a product roadmap:
  * **Sound strategy** - roadmap must be based on souind strategy
  * **Realistic** - roadmap must be realistic (for estimates and feasibility etc)
  * **Fully supported** - it must e fully supported by key product stakeholders
* Most common reason for failure of a product roadmap is that one or more of these three steps were made shortcut.

* In many organizations a strong persuasive leader, caring deeply about future of business, very knowlegeable about the market usually believe that they know exactly what to be built. This person is usually founder or CEO or sales leader or CTO or even the product leader.
* These leaders usually use their intution to build the product roadmap and then use their persuasion powers to push it out to the whole organization.
* In rare occasions very talented person like Steeve Job's case, the intutions are corect, but usually it does not work that way. The challenge of working with such a talented person is that the product manager need to have the added challenge of **channeling the person's energy into a process** ensuring us to endup with a successful roadmap.
* It is extremely important to not let the person's intuition dictate the roadmap. Reasons:
  * The **intuition can be faulty** and the information from other stakeholders may not be taken into consideration. So roadmap could result from a flawed assumption about the market or could be just unrealistic.
  * As other stakeholders might not be part of decision making process, **alignment could be missing** and some **people might not support** the roadmap or worse actively trying to undermine it.
  
* Ways to handle this problem of "leadership intuition dictating roadmap"
1. Spend time with these strong leaders at the beginning of the process.
    * Ask them for their ideas about the roadmap and 
    * Ask about the development projects that are most important to them.
2. Ask for underlying thought
    * thought undertaken for selection of their projects
    * Capture their valuable knowledge on market and customers
3. Explain the importance of including other stakeholders in the process
    * After this person is fully heard, and opinions recorded explain the importance of including other stakeholders.
    * Let them know that the stakeholders are more likely to be aligned and actively support the plan if their opinions are solicited and incorporated.
4. Esitimate the development time.
    * Explain the leader that the estimation of development time will be a good idea as the plan will be solid.
    * If they object, explain them that you can run the estimation process quickly and it does not need to slow you down. Usually the logic will appeal to those in charge and they will support the rest of the process.

</details>

### Selecting Stakeholders
<details><summary><b>Selecting stakeholders</b></summary>
 
  * Missing a key person will hunt you later.
  * Including a person not central to your plan's success will waste your time and also may drag the whole process.
 
  #### Stakeholders (core team of roadmap development)
  1. The Product Leader (you)   
  2. Business leader (CEO or general manager of your business unit) is most important and your partner in building the roadmap.
     * This person should be leading business functions other than product development including sales, marketing and customer-support.
     * This leader is needed for allocation of resources (esp headcount).
     * Also they are needed to remind each of the stakeholders to prioritize the tasks necessary for roadmap success.
     * Hence include them early and often in the process of roadmap development.
     * They must feel complete ownership.
  3. Sales Leader (VP Sales or chief revenue officer)
      * They have to hit the sales target based on the product roadmap and we don't want friction there.
      * Companies tend to organize around revenue streams and the sales leader will have the ability to rally other resources to make the roadmap successful.
  4. Product Development Leader (e.g. CTO or VP of Engineering)
      * They will organize and motivate their team to hit the roadmap milestones.

  * In large organizations teams are organized functionally, hence it is not easy to identify the stakeholders.
      * We may need one person deep inside the sales group and another one from deep insite the engineering group, each of them reporting up into their own larger functional organizations.
  * When working across groups (of a large organization), use the sales leader as your business leader, as there might not be a single clear business leader. 
  
  * We can include other stakeholders in the process at least for some key decisions.
    * We can also include a strong operational leader (e.g. COO or VP of Customer service) if our product is going to require a lot of operational work, as it will add a lot of value.
    * Whomever we choose to include to, make sure they will be adding to not distracting from the process.
  
</details>

### Researching customers
<details><summary><b>Researching customers</b></summary>

* __How to earn respect as Product Manager:__ More you know about your customer and your market, more you can speak with authority about the impact of specific product development options.
* __Customer knowledge__ is the primary currency of a Product Manager.
* To understand more about your customers talk to them. Consider the following requirements:
  1. What decisions do your customers need to make? (in choosing your product).
  2. What problems are they trying to solve?
  3. What other options are available of them, today?
      * Sometimes it is between your product and your competitor's and sometimes it is your product and doing nothing.
      
* Best way to find these details is to ask the customer directly.
* Common ways for __Customer Research__
    * Large companies usually will have a research group which will have the answers to our questions.
    1. If there is no such group, then you will need to __initiate a research group__
    2. More likely you will need to __Ask your customers yourself__.
        * May be you design a survey and send it out to a small sample of your target customers using some of the widely available __survey software tools__ .
    3. __Participate in Sales and Customer Service meetings__ either as an active or passive participant. 
* Direct qualitative customer research yields more insights more quicly that other ways. HOW to do it:
    1. Reach out to your customers directly.
        * Reach out to a handful of your customers directly with a personal phone call or email.
        * Introduce yourself as the product manager and ask them for a few minutes of their time to learn about their experience using your product. (Many will respond positively to such a request).
    2. Watch them use your product
        * In your conversation, after you introduce yourself, ask them to share their screen and watch them actually using your product, listening to their observations along the way.
    2. Ask them questions about your product:
        * Why they decided to try your product?
        * What their other options were?
        * Whether or not they plan to continue with your product and why?
        * What they wish the product did differently?
* How many customers should you talk to?
    * Practically for most products 5 customer conversations is often enough.
    Even from first few conversations we will get a lot of insights like:
        * What they need?
        * How they make decisions
        * What the product needs to do diferently in order to achieve the business goals.
* With all these insights brought into the team you will be able to speak with authority and it will bring in respect for you as product manager.
</details>

#### Product Strategy Document
<details><summary>Product Strategy Document</b></summary>

The quality of a roadmap can not be evaluated without understanding the strategy of the company.
  * You can not know the quality of  a roadmap unless you know bit more about the business.
  1. Who my customers are?
  2. What their needs are?
  3. What features our product currently has?
  4. How well the product is meeting the needs of our customers today?
  5. What are the competing products in the market and what functionality do they have?

Regarding business objective:
  * May be I want to capture the whole market.
  * May be I just want to build a strong business in a niche segment (with unique requirements/customers/products).
  * May be I want to grow revenue
  * Or may be I want to acquire new users

First step in product roadmap development:
* Crearly articulate product strategy
    * A __productr strategy__ describes how your company or business unit will achieve its business goals.
    * Product strategy should typically answer following questions (write the answers in a brief document):
        1. What are your business goals?
        1.b. How will you measure success?
        2. Who are your target customers? (Which customers you really want to win?)
        3. What customer needs you are trying to meet? (key needs)
        4. What benefits your product will provide to these target customers?
        5. Who are your key competitors?
        6. What other options do your customers have?
        7. What are the key differentiators between your product and those of your competitors?

* You should make the business owner feel like owner of this strategy.
* Business owners must be key participant in developing the roadmap. They must promote and defend it actively with the senior members of your team.
* The product strategy document that you prepare should be the document owned by business leader not yours. But you must ensure that the document answers all these questions to a sufficient level of specificity. 

* Discuss the product strategy with each of the product stakeholders
    * Do this once the business leader has a product strategy articulated in a shared document or a short set of slides.
    * Start with one on one meetings where people feel comfortable giving you their unbiased feedback and concerns.
    * Then after incorporating all one-on-one feedbacks have one group meeting where everyone discusses and hopefully agrees to support the strategy.
    * Without this alignment from the stakeholders you need to go back and do it all over again.
* Building roadmap can be started after the product strategy is ready and key stakeholders are aligned around it.

</details>

### Identifying milestones
###### (part of Decision Making and Building Alignment)
<details><summary><b>Identifying milestones</b></summary>

* Find out the sequence of milestones that implement best that product strategy.
1. Start with your own research and thinking.
2. Reread your product strategy.
    * What are the barriers to achieving this strategy?
    * And which barriers can be removed or at least improved by changing your product in some way?
3. Research the market and in particular your target customers (spend some time)
    * Understand the decisions customers make when choosing to use your product.
    * Think about the barriers that prevent your target customers from adopting your product.
4. Try to imagine major product changes.
    * While thinking about the barriers to handle, think about these changes that you believe would have the desired impact on the strategic objective.
    * Often these will be the features that your customers have asked directly.
    * Sometimes these features if implemented would benefit them but those have not occurred to them yet.
    
* Milestones can be impactful in different ways:
    * Some milestones address pain points of existing customers.
        * increasing their usage OR
        * reducing their churn
    * Some milestones may allow your customer to use your product in new ways and reduce some of the appeals of competing prodcuts.
    * Some milestones may be intended to open  up new markets for an existing product
    * Some milestones may be for even launching a new product that has strategic value to the business.
    * Some milestones may not directly benefit customers but would benefit some other strategic objective
        * like opening up a new distribution channel OR
        * lowering your cost structure.
* Ensure that you are thinking of these milestones at the right level of granularity, and these are not backlog tasks.
* These milestones should be 
    * major product changes
    * which will take significant amount of research, design and development work
    * and will correspond to dozens of tasks on the backlog.
* Against each milestone be sure to record
    * the strategic objective the milestone supports and
    * the rationale behind the objective - The rationale should be at high level and easy to understand.
* An example of setting an milestone:
    * If your strategy is to acquire a cost conscious customer segment, 
    * reducing service delivery cost could be your strategic objective
    * putting milestones for automating some manual tasks or switching service providers could be the options to reduce cost.
* Initially we may not be having dates on the milestones as we donot know yet how long they will take.
* We can try putting these milestones in a rough priority order, by brainstorming.
* Meet each stakeholders to see whether they can think of any that you might have missed. Meet to one-on-one to increase chances of getting their ideas freely.
    1. Start by reviewing the product strategy.
    2. Ask about what you might have missed.
    3. Ask them for ideas about which milestones would best support the product strategy.
    4. Once their ideas are exhausted, review other milestones you proposed with them and ask for their feedback and also their sense of priorities.
* Finally you will end up with a sequence of product milestones, each with measurable impacts on one of your strategic objectives and which together will implement your product strategy.

</details>

### Estimating effort
Esitmate levels of effort to complete the milestones on you rproduct roadmap

<details><summary>Estimate Levels of Effort (for milestones)</summary>

* Work with product development leader on this effort estimation.
1. Estimate the development capacity of your team.
  * Usually measured in developer time units like developer days, developer weeks or developer months.
  * Typically developer tiem is spread across development, bug fixing, produc tmaintenance, and engineering-driven projects.
  * Ask your product development leader to estimate the amount of time team currently spends on these items.
    * Easily computed as a fraction of their overall capacity.
    * For example: May be 25% of their time in bug fixing, 20% on product maintenenance, and 20% on engineering.
    * The remaining leftover capacity is available for development of new functionality for your roadmap projects, e.g. 35% of the total in above example (once removed the time spent on these items).
2. Estimate the likely "development time" for each milestone (along with the product development leader)
  * Capture this information in a spreadsheet.
  * A typical layout can have one row per milestone with the fields "Milestone name", "Strategic Objective", "Summary of milestone", "Source", "development Time"
  * Milestones are more larger and complex than a typical backlog task.
    * It will be quite difficult for the product development leader to estimate the scope and they might even be reluctant to try.
  * Make them clear that you are asking for their best guess, but you are not asking them or their team to commit to these estimates. Put a disclaimer like "__*Please use your best estimate__" at the top of your spreadsheet to remind everyone that these are only estimates and are subject to change.
  * If some of the milestones are too small, we can group those into a larger milestone that supports some element of the strategy.
  * If some milestones are too large, see if there is a way you can decompose them into smaller milestone while making sure that each still has a independent business impact.
3. Once done with the phase-2 we would have a apreadsheet with enough information to build a product roadmap with milestones that are realistic for the team to complete. 

</details>

<details><summary>Build the first draft of Product Roadmap</summary>

  1. Sequence your miletones
      * Sequence the milestones roughly In terms of their value in supporting your product strategy.
      * Go through them one at time and remind yourself of the rationale for each milestone and prioritize them.
  2. Schedule these milestones into your roadmap.
      * Look at your highest priority milestone
      * Figure out when on calendar you could expect the milestone to be delivered
          * Use the effort estimates provided by your product development leader
          * Also use the developmnet capacity of the team.
      * Now pick the second highest priority milestone
          * Assume that the first milestone was compelted on time
          * Schedule the seocnd one in the same manner.
      * In this case we will have a roadmap with a step-like formation with some different milestones overlapping in a same quarter etc.
  3. There is another approach to roadmap scheduling:
      * You can instead look at the time periods out into the future like the next four quarters or next six months.
      * Identify high-priority milestones that can eb completed together.
      * Identify lower priority milestones for the second time period and so on.
      * Once done we will have a roadmap like Q1: (milestone1, milestone2), Q2: (milestones 3, 4, 5), Q3: (milestones 6,7), Q4: (milestone 8) etc.
  4. In each case be mindful of the total development capacity of your team in each time period.

* This approach has the advantage that it sets less precise expectations about the exact delivery date of each milestone, which can be a good thing, because the scope estimates are approximate anyway.

* Complexities in larger organizations:
    * In larger product development organizations, you'll probably have multiple development teams working in parallel.
    * If the teams are organized around distinct products or customers, like publisher tools and advertiser tools, you'd probably have separate milestones for each of them, and should schedule them separately.
    * In such cases the roadmap can be drawn with separate rows of releases, set on the same horizontal time axis one above the other.

* Complexities with functionally grouped teams:
    * Scheduling becomes more challenging if the teams are organized functionally, so that each team owns different system components, like a front-end team and back-end team.
    * If this is the case, you need to figure out the capacity and effort required of each team separately.
    * You'll also need to schedule the milestones in such a way that each of the teams will have enough capacity to complete each of the milestones in the time period you schedule it for.

* Once you're done and have a completed schedule, take a step back and run a sanity check on your strawman (draft roadmap) from a few perspectives.
    * First, ask yourself __if it implements your product strategy__. Try to make adjustments so the impact on the product strategy is maximized. 
    * Ask yourself, __is it feasible from a development resource perspective?__ Run it by your development leader again, and make any adjustments they deem necessary.
    * If the answers to these questions are yes, then you've got a strawman, and are ready to share this draft roadmap with your team.

</details>

<details><summary><b>The Product Roadmap Meeting</b></summary>

  * Plan and run this critical meeting in close collaboration with your business leader like your CEO or general manager
    * since they directly manage most of the product stakeholders 
    * and have the authority to ask for their participation.

  * Purpose of product roadmap is not the document itself but the __alignment of the different product stakeholders__ around the development plan that your roadmap represents.
  * The meeting steps:
    1. At the start of the meeting, explain the goal, to emerge with a shared product roadmap that all stakeholders fully support and can use in their own planning.
    2. The first item on the agenda should be a quick review of your product strategy.
        * Explain that it is the foundation and that the roadmap must be designed to implement the strategy.
        * It is critical that you check for alignment at this stage. If your team is not aligned on the strategy, it is pointless to discuss the roadmap.
    3. The second item on the agenda is to review the development capacity of your team.
        * Have your development leader present the team's capacity and explain how their time will be spent on things other than new product development such as bug fixing and engineering-driven projects.
    4. Next on the agenda should be a walk through of your product roadmap draft (straw man).
        * Present each milestone one at a time as well as the strategic objective for each.
        * Try to get through all the milestones before you start making changes just so people know everything under consideration.
        * Remind the team that each of the milestones has an associated developer time estimate and 
        * also remind that the releases on the roadmap are designed to fit within the limited resources.
    5. At this point, ask your team what they wish was different in the roadmap draft (straw man).
        * It is important in this step to hear some diverse opinions about the roadmap.
        * This is how you'll actually surface the important issues facing the business.
    6. It is best to modify the product roadmap directly in the meeting so everyone can see the consequences.
        * It's best to work together using a live spreadsheet.
    7. Show the team the tradeoffs of the decisions they are making.
        * It's critical that when you agree to move one milestone up to an earlier release date or time period, you also then have to remove other milestones of equal size to compensate and push them back to a later date.
        * Sometimes this will result in negotiations or trading between team members.
        * For instance, one person might give up a feature in the next quarter to gain something else immediately.
        * This can help resolve disagreements.
    8. Think about future success
        * As you proceed, keep inviting the group to think about the future success of the business rather than just their own interests.
        * In the best case, the team will reach consensus.
    9. Align the team with the decision
        * It's not always possible to get the whole team to agree fully with the roadmap.
        * But you do need to make sure that the whole team is aligned with the decision.
        * In this case, it's your __business leader's job__ to make the final decision and check for alignment with the rest of the team. 
        * If you haven't gotten to this point by the time the meeting is over, schedule a followup session to resume the process.
        * At the end of the meeting, everyone should be looking at the revised product roadmap in the spreadsheet and agreeing to support it publicly.
    * Now final product roadmap is ready.
</details>

#### Evangelize the roadmap

<details><summary>Presenting and Rolling out Product Roadmap</summary>

#### Preparation for presentation of Product roadmap

  * Create a short presentation for the roadmap
      * This presentation should simply presents the key elements and decisions of the product roadmap as well as the rationale behind them.
  * Presentation contents:
      * Top-level objectives
      * Target customers
      * Competitive advantage
          * How you plan to win them over to your product from the competition.
      * Put a product roadmap diagram
          * Which shows time periods on the x-axis and different customers or product categoreis on the y-axis if needed.
      * List the milestones in a grid
          * A table with columns "Milestone", "Strategic Objective",  "Summary", "Source", "Time" in a tabular form.
      * Include few rationale slide one for each of the key decisions where you had to favour one important project over another.
          * These slides are especially important for projects that got delayed but are popular with some set of customers or internal stakeholders.
          * It is important to show the project supporters that you understand how important the project is to them and there is a good reason why it was deplayed.
      * Schedule a series of 1-on-1 meetings
          * where you present the new roadmap to any product stakeholder
              * who will be impacted by it 
              * or who did not participate in ht eroadmap development process.
              * -- These could be leaders fo operation, customer service, technical support, finance, legal and so on.
              * -- In these meetings explain the decisions made by the team and the thinking behind it.
      * Check for alignment again (at the end of these one-on-ones)
          * You might say something like:
              * *"I know you're not getting everything you wanted here, but can you live with this?"*
              * *"Or is there something we need to revisit with the CEO?"*
              * *"If there are any major issues that the decision-making team missed, you'll have to raise them again to the whole group."*

#### Rolling out the product roadmap
  * Once all the one-on-one meetings are completed and all the key stakeholders are aligned:
      * it's time to roll out the roadmap to the entire company or business unit that it'll impact.
      * It's best to do this as part of an all-hands meeting.
      * This large group meeting is expensive so your presentation should be brief about 10 to 20 minutes max. Any longer and you'll lose a lot of your audience.
      * It's also a best practice to do a public question and answer session at the end of your presentation.
      * Always present the roadmap as a team effort. It's not my roadmap and I decided, but it is our roadmap and we decided.
  * If appropriate, make sure your external facing teams also have an easy way to share the roadmap with your customers and partners.
      * Often this takes the form of a one-pager that your sales people and account managers can share with them.
  * Once these meetings are over, your work is done.
      * Your whole organization and its customers and partners can now operate in close coordination with your product development plan.

### Maintaining the roadmap

<details><summary>When and Why to update Product Roadmap</summary>

  * Product roadmaps are usually dynamic documents (Even though some of your stakeholders might wish otherwise).
  * They represent your organization's development plan at a particular point in time based on the best information available to you at that point in time.
  * You'll need to update your roadmap, when you learn new information about your customers or the market.
  * So how do you know when it's time to update your roadmap?
      * When you've learned something new that makes the old roadmap no longer seem like the optimal course of action.
      * There are several types of new information that you might encounter.
          * First, you might've learned information about your customers' needs and desires.
              * For example, you might've tried out a new pricing model and found out that your customers won't accept it.
          * Second, it could be information about your competitors.
              * Say you've just read a major announcement from one of your competitors which makes them more of a threat than you thought.
          * And third, you might've learned something new about the time or cost of product development.
              * The projects that you prioritized on your roadmap might be taking much longer than anticipated to complete.
      * In all of these cases, you'll probably want to revise your roadmap.
      * Sometimes, team members may approach you and ask for changes to the roadmap.
      * In these cases, it's important that you try to understand the reason for the change.
          * What's the new information that's been learned since the last roadmap update?
          * In some cases, you might find that there really is something new.
          * But in others, you may discover that one of your team members is still not aligned with the decisions made in the previous iteration and still trying to promote their point of view.
              * in which case (in case of team misalignment), you might want to alert your business leader.
  * The frequency of roadmap updates can vary widely between organizations.
  * If the product you're working on is very immature,
      * you're probably learning new information all the time,
      * so your roadmap will probably change very frequently.
  * If the product is much more mature, and your market is very stable,
      * you might not need to revise your roadmap at all, that is, until everything's been released.
  * Remember that the decision about whether and when to update the roadmap is __your responsibility__. As the product leader, you're the guardian of the product roadmap.

## Product Roadmap Summary
<details open><summary>Product Roadmap summary</summary>

* Key points is to know how to 
    * articulate your strategy and milestones, 
    * estimate scope, and 
    * ultimately schedule them into a roadmap that implements your product strategy.

* Following the concepts in Chapter Two, start by spending some time with your customers.
    * Make sure you deeply understand their needs and how they think about your product.
    * Then figure out who your key product stakeholders are and schedule a strategy meeting with them.
    * Use this time to get everyone aligned around your product strategy.
* Next, using the process described in Chapter Three, build your first roadmap and share it with your company.
    * Identify the product milestones that will best implement your strategy and 
    * scope the milestones with your product development leader, and put them into a realistic schedule.
    * Get your stakeholders together again to review, modify, and ultimately approve your product roadmap.
    * Then share it out with the rest of your company and, if appropriate, your customers and partners.
* Finally, remember that the product roadmap is a living document.
    * Keep your roadmap relevant by reviewing the market and customer assumptions that it's based on and 
    * initiate a process to update it when you think it's necessary.
* In the end, it's not producing a pretty or elegant roadmap that counts, it's aligning your team around it.
